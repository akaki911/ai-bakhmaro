# Firebase Hosting default page troubleshooting

## Why the Firebase welcome page appears

Firebase Hosting is configured to serve static files from `frontend/dist` according to [`firebase.json`](../firebase.json). When the content in that directory has not been built and deployed, Hosting falls back to the default `index.html` that ships with the Firebase setup wizard. As a result, visiting the production domain shows the "Firebase Hosting Setup Complete" welcome card instead of the real application UI.

## Why your React/Vite front-end is not loading

This project uses Vite with the entry point defined in [`index.html`](../index.html) and a production build generated by the `vite build` script in [`package.json`](../package.json). Running that build produces compiled assets (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) that need to be uploaded to Firebase Hosting. If the build step is skipped—or if the deployment points to a folder that does not contain the freshly built `index.html`—Firebase will continue serving the default placeholder page.

## How to fix it

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
2. Generate the production bundle: `npm run build`.
3. Deploy the new assets to Firebase Hosting: `firebase deploy --only hosting` (make sure you are authenticated with the correct Firebase project).

After redeploying with the built assets present in `frontend/dist`, Firebase will serve the actual front-end instead of the setup placeholder.

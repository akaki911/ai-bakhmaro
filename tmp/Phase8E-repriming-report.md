# Phase 8E — AI Re-Priming Report

## Persona Updates
- Updated `shared/gurulo-core/gurulo.prompts.js` persona line to explicitly state: “Gurulo is the AI Developer Assistant for ai.bakhmaro.co — focused on coding, debugging, and automation tasks.”
- Verified `ai-service/context/system_prompts.js` pulls the refreshed core persona for all modes.

## Context & Prompt Cleanup
- Reviewed `ai-service/context` modules (system prompts, code context, project context, git prompts, user preferences) to confirm they reference developer workflows only and contain no legacy booking/business wording.
- Confirmed predefined responses in `ai-service/controllers/ai_controller.js` emphasize coding support and omit business roles.
- Ensured `ai-service/services/gurulo_response_builder.js` and `gurulo_intent_router.js` return developer-focused guidance exclusively.

## Knowledge Base
- `ai-service/knowledge_base.json` already documented the automation/developer pipeline; no booking terminology remained.

## Static Summaries
- Refactored `backend/services/site_summary.js` to rename the legacy `booking_process` template to `operations_flow`, removing residual booking terminology while keeping the operational workflow summary intact.

## Memory & Residual Checks
- Scanned memory preference defaults (`ai-service/context/user_preferences.js`) and related helpers; no booking-related entries persist.

## Verification Steps
- `pnpm -C ai-frontend build`
- `pnpm -C functions build`

# Phase 8A-2 Cleanup Report

## Summary
- Purged legacy lodging terminology from Gurulo AI prompts, builders, routers, and project context files so the service now speaks exclusively about developer workflows.
- Updated response builders, intent routing, and streaming prompts to reinforce Gurulo's role as the ai.bakhmaro.co full-stack assistant and removed obsolete stay-related handlers.
- Refreshed project documentation, knowledge utilities, and diagnostic helpers to reflect the AI development workspace with no references to hospitality flows.
- Adjusted automated tests and code analyzers to validate developer-centric scenarios and eliminated questions about the retired lodging flows.

## Verification Steps
- `pnpm -C ai-frontend build`
- `pnpm -C functions build`

Both builds completed successfully after the vocabulary cleanup.

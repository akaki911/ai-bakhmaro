# Phase 8A-5b Report

## Removed Files
- `ai-service/services/proposal_memory_provider.js` (superseded by provider-free memory store module)

## Code Updates
- Updated `ai-service/routes/auto_improve.js` to consume the renamed proposal memory store service.
- Added `ai-service/services/proposal_memory_store.js` to keep proposal outcome lookups without provider terminology.
- Replaced all backend event-log references to the old service path in `backend/data/auto_improve_event_store.json` to eliminate provider mentions.

## Verification
- `pnpm -C ai-frontend build`
- `pnpm -C functions build`

# Phase 8A-5a-1 â€” Firestore Cleanup Report

## Firestore audit
- Searched backend sources for `bookings` and `providerBookings` Firestore operations; none remain in services, routes, or controllers.
- Confirmed no `db.collection('bookings')` or `db.collection('providerBookings')` queries exist after the purge.
- Memory- and AI-related routes were left untouched per scope instructions.

## Test updates
- Rewrote backend AI regression scenarios to focus on audit, security, and admin tooling instead of booking workflows.
- Updated Groq response smoke prompts to cover audit logging, trusted devices, secret scanning, and developer panel support.
- Final scenario suite now validates trusted-device, environment verification, secret management, and observability flows without booking dependencies.

## Notes
- Static descriptive strings that mention historical booking modules remain in knowledge-oriented services (e.g., `site_summary`) because they do not trigger Firestore access.
- Functions build passes locally (`pnpm -C functions build`).

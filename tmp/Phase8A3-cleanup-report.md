# Phase 8A-3 Cleanup Summary

## Removed assets
- Deleted `functions/scheduledCommission.js` and eliminated the commission build step.
- Removed deprecated provider-centric helpers in the frontend (`useStubData`, `BankInfoForm`, `validation.ts`).
- Dropped legacy backend backups referencing commission routes.

## Backend updates
- Purged provider role handling from middleware, admin routes, and JWT logic.
- Simplified admin user management to only allow super-admin creation and removed provider-specific validation.
- Updated backup fallback responses to expose `engine` instead of provider labels.
- Cleansed platform summaries and AI test scenarios of provider/finance references.

## Frontend updates
- Excised provider/bank vocabulary across React pages, contexts, and admin panels.
- Reworked backup controls to rely on neutral `engine` terminology throughout hooks, services, and UI components.
- Adjusted device management, security audit, and auth flows to operate without provider roles.
- Updated documentation to replace “provider” phrasing with neutral alternatives.

## Follow-up notes
- AI service routes still surface third-party model provider naming; untouched per safety directive.
- Backup status now expects the `engine` field; ensure upstream services emit it when enabling automated backups.

## Removed Integrations
- Deleted the Codex Slack agent and all Slack-specific hooks from the AI service runtime.
- Stripped Slack notification logic from Codex agent execution and streaming flows.
- Removed Slack metadata plumbing from AI service routes and auto-improve requests.

## Frontend & Registry Updates
- Pruned Slack connector stubs from the AI frontend connector manager and registry service.
- Updated backend connector registry and documentation to reflect the removal of Slack integrations.
- Simplified auto-improve alert settings to drop Slack toggle state.

## Configuration Cleanup
- Purged notification-related secret placeholders from `backend/data/secrets_store.json`.
- Removed Slack/notification references across architecture, operations, and environment docs.
- Adjusted system watchdog comments to reference future email/status integrations only.

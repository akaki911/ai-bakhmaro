# Phase 8C Cleanup Report

## Summary of Removals and Updates
- **backend/services/gurulo_brain_status.js** – replaced finance-focused recovery copy with webhook delivery terminology to eliminate payment references while keeping incident telemetry intact.
- **backend/services/fileService.js** – removed the Georgian-to-English synonym mapping for payments and introduced sync-related vocabulary for search term expansion.
- **backend/services/codeAnalyzer.js** – dropped payment keyword expansion and added synchronization terminology to keep relevance suggestions accurate.
- **backend/routes/dev_console.js** – updated mock DevConsole events to describe webhook signature failures instead of payment gateway issues.
- **backend/middleware/error_handler.js** – removed payment-related error translations and replaced them with synchronization failure messaging.
- **ai-frontend/src/utils/createTestLogs.ts** – rewrote user interaction error scenarios and debug traces to reference webhook confirmations instead of payment flows.
- **ai-frontend/src/features/devconsole-v2/useConsoleStream.ts** – refreshed generated mock message catalog to remove payment processing errors.
- **ai-frontend/src/services/mockDataGenerator.ts** – replaced payment gateway failure log templates with webhook delivery diagnostics.

## Verification Steps
- Confirmed prohibited finance keywords are absent with repository-wide searches: `rg -i "payment"`, `rg -i "payout"`, `rg -i "commission"`, `rg -i "bank"`, and `rg -i "providerEarnings"` (excluding build artifacts) – all returned no matches.
- Builds:
  - `pnpm -C functions build`
  - `pnpm -C ai-frontend build`

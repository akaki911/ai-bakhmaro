# Final Clean Audit – Bakhmaro Rental Code Removal

## Result
⚠️ Findings — Rental-era logic and content are still present across multiple active services, cloud functions, and archived backups.

## Banned Keyword Scan Summary
The repository was scanned for the following terms: booking, calendar, cottage, hotel, vehicle, horse, snowmobile, provider, commission, messaging, notification, bank. Matches were found in both active services and backup directories. Representative examples are documented below.

### Active Service References
- **AI service** still responds with booking-specific helpers (e.g., hard-coded explanations for `BookingService.ts` and `BookingModal.tsx`).【F:ai-service/controllers/ai_controller.js†L1388-L1408】
- **AI knowledge base** enumerates bookings, providers, cottages/hotels/vehicles/horses/snowmobiles as core features and continues to advertise the “Bakhmaro booking platform.”【F:ai-service/services/site_summary.js†L73-L120】【F:ai-service/README.md†L2-L15】
- **Firestore backup routine** exports legacy collections including `cottages`, `bookings`, and rental reviews.【F:ai-service/services/backup_system_service.js†L160-L199】
- **Rental policies** are still rendered in AI responses (e.g., “Bookings are confirmed with a 30% deposit…”).【F:ai-service/services/gurulo_response_builder.js†L591-L603】
- **Search term expansion** maps Georgian booking terminology to rental modules (BookingModal, BookingService, HotelCard, VehicleCard, HorseCard, SnowmobileForm, etc.).【F:ai-service/services/file_access_service.js†L41-L56】
- **Context metadata** labels the backend as “Node.js + Express API for bookings,” keeping rental hooks in system prompts and architecture hints.【F:ai-service/context/code_context.js†L102-L123】
- **Backend AI controller** still primes Groq with “You are an AI assistant for the Bakhmaro booking platform.”【F:backend/ai_controller.js†L120-L153】
- **Backend routes** expose booking conversation plumbing (`bookingId`, `listingType`) and log `booking_activity` events.【F:backend/routes/messaging.js†L1-L103】【F:backend/routes/user_activity.js†L1-L55】
- **Cloud Functions** manage commission invoicing, enforce payments, watch the `bookings/{bookingId}` collection, and update provider commission rates.【F:functions/scheduledCommission.js†L1-L222】

### Tests & Tooling Still Target Rentals
- Legacy AI test suite continues to ask about `bookingService.ts`, `BookingModal`, transport bookings, and messaging flows.【F:test_ai_scenarios.js†L1-L33】
- Similar prompts are repeated across backend/ai-service integration tests and Groq scripts (see `ai-service/test_*`, `backend/test_*`). These rely on the same booking terminology highlighted above.

### Archived/Backup Modules (Still in Repo)
- `backup_before_restore/src/AdminProviderBookings.tsx` fetches Firestore bookings for cottages/hotels/vehicles/horses/snowmobiles with status management dashboards.【F:backup_before_restore/src/AdminProviderBookings.tsx†L26-L79】
- `backup_before_restore/src/AdminCommission.tsx` maintains commission tracking per provider/resource type and writes to `commissions` collection.【F:backup_before_restore/src/AdminCommission.tsx†L25-L78】
- `backup_before_restore/src/AdminProviders.tsx` loads providers from Firestore, toggles activation, and manages rental-specific fields (business type, address).【F:backup_before_restore/src/AdminProviders.tsx†L30-L78】
- Additional backup assets (e.g., `backup_attached_assets/…`) still import `BookingModal`, count bookings, and expose rental-specific UI.

### Firestore & Finance Artifacts
- Commission and provider bookkeeping remain in both active code (`functions/scheduledCommission.js`) and backup dashboards noted above, violating the “no finance/commissions/payouts” requirement.【F:functions/scheduledCommission.js†L45-L222】【F:backup_before_restore/src/AdminCommission.tsx†L25-L78】

## Required Feature Verification
Key Gurulo AI features remain available in the repo:
- **AI Developer Panel UI** imports Chat, Console, Explorer, Auto-Improve, Memory, GitHub, and Settings tabs under a single shell.【F:ai-frontend/src/components/AIDeveloperPanel.tsx†L29-L57】
- **Gurulo AI microservice + SSE DevConsole V2** expose `/api/ai/stream` with Server-Sent Events via `routes/ai_stream.js` and integrate shared Gurulo core utilities.【F:ai-service/routes/ai_stream.js†L1-L76】
- **WebAuthn Super Admin login** remains in `AdminPasskeyLogin.tsx`, using `@simplewebauthn/browser` with admin-specific endpoints.【F:ai-frontend/src/pages/AdminPasskeyLogin.tsx†L1-L62】

## Build Verification
- `pnpm -C ai-frontend build` — ✅ succeeded (vite build; large bundle warning only).【c43e31†L1-L25】
- `pnpm -C functions build` — ✅ succeeded (Node syntax checks passed; engine warning only).【f6395a†L1-L5】

## Conclusion
Rental-related logic is still widespread in active AI services, backend endpoints, Firebase functions, and bundled backups. Repository is **not yet clean**; removal or relocation of the highlighted modules is required before the codebase can represent the Gurulo AI Space system exclusively.

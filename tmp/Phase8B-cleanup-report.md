# Phase 8B Cleanup Report

## Removed assets and knowledge
- Deleted `knowledge_source/cottage_rules.md` to eliminate legacy cottage guidance.
- Removed the unused `.cottage-image` styling hook from `ai-frontend/src/index.css`.

## Backend updates
- Replaced `backend/services/site_summary.js` content with AI-operations context, new categories, updated component mappings, and topic lists without rental entities.
- Refreshed `backend/services/codeAnalyzer.js` to target AI/monitoring modules, adjust keyword expansions, and rewrite fallback messaging.
- Simplified `backend/services/pricing_explainer.js` to clarify that pricing logic no longer exists in the backend.
- Updated `backend/services/groq_service.js` and `backend/ai_controller.js` prompts/static replies to describe AI operations, monitoring, and security workflows.
- Tuned `backend/services/fileService.js` search expansions and `backend/utils/rpid.js` branding to remove resource-type terminology.

## Frontend updates
- Retitled platform references in `replit.md`, `restart-servers.js`, and `ai-frontend/src/components/ChatPanel.tsx` to match the AI operations focus.

## Build verification
- `pnpm -C functions build` (passes with Node engine warning). 【6791ea†L1-L6】
- `pnpm -C ai-frontend build` (passes; expected terser fallback and chunk-size warning). 【99a572†L1-L25】
